## Scheduled Talks
Talks are managed by a creating a [creating new issue](https://github.com/elixir-melbourne/meetup/issues/new) on this repo.

Members are welcome to create one or more issues for talks they want to give. Organisers will schedule them from there. (see [Melbourne Ruby](https://github.com/rails-oceania/melbourne-ruby/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) for an example of how this works).

At this stage, we want to mix it up and not just have talks every month. So there will be a mix of hacknights, randori etc.

## Organisers
- Julian Doherty ([@madlep](https://github.com/madlep))
- Gus Gollings ([@gusgollings](https://github.com/gusgollings))
- Sean St. Quentin ([@elseano](https://github.com/elseano))
